# Project 3 - Starter Kit - Symfony 5.3

## Presentation

This starter kit is here to easily start a repository for Wild Code School students.

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional library (webpack, fixtures) and tools to validate code standards.

* GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :
  
    * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR12 
    * PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code (without actually running it)
    * PHPmd will check if you follow PHP best practices
     
  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

* Github Action as Continuous Integration will be run when a branch with active pull request is updated on github. It will run :

    * Tasks to check if vendor, .idea, env.local are not versionned,
    * PHP_CodeSniffer, PHPStan and PHPmd with same configuration as GrumPHP.
